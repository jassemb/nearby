“Explore a new level of connectivity”


### Team:

### Jassem Ben Ali-Project Manager:

“I took responsibility of all the project roles, I would like to build the whole project by myself from scratch to enhance my experience and skills” 

### Technologies:

## 'flutter':
```Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile,web, and desktop from a single codebase. It’s has fast development, beautiful & expressive UI, and native performance```
## 'Firebase':
```Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment```

## Challenge:
```enhance the app’s customers lifestyle by making their necessities accessible in shorter period of time (exp: Nearby Workshops) The app won’t be precise when it comes to finding all the necessities of the customer but it will offer a decent amount of assistance.```

# The app will come in aid for those who need guidance in unknown places and improve their experience by enhancing their knowledge about their surroundings.the project depends on the user’s location.

# Risks:

```Poor UX/UI Integration:```
```An application's UI and UX are essential for a mobile app development company. Users tend to interact with apps that seem to be user-friendly and provide a great user experience. A decent interface allows the user to traverse a web presence. That can be a problem with flutter so I would use Figma as an alternative.```

```Poor interaction with the app:```
```The app requires the users to interact with it in order to keep providing service, ( Exp: the user should recommend a place to be added in the app that wasn’t formally present )```
